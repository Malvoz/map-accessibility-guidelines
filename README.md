# Map Accessibility Guidelines
A set of guidelines for developers, cartographers, GIS specialists, geographers, and civic hackers to consider when creating projects including web maps.

Check out some [Best Practices](/BestPractices.md), [code snippets](/code-snippets), our [Wiki site](../../wiki), and some [key resources](../../wiki/Resources) for some guidelines and resources we've put together.

## NACIS Presentation :earth_americas:
On **Thurs, Oct. 15th, 2015** from **4:00-5:10 p.m.** we will be presenting at the [NACIS Conference](http://www.nacis.org) in Minneapolis in the **[Community-Oriented Cartography](http://sched.co/3l8M)** session in **Charles Frost** *(225 3rd Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55401)* with our abstract titled **_Starting Conversations for More Accessible Maps_**.

### Abstract
*In today’s age, there can often be a disconnect between the message an analyst wants to deliver with a map or app, and the perception users will have of it. Cartographers’ choices can sometimes cause a map’s message to be misconstrued or lost completely to different groups of users. We’re a group of GIS enthusiasts who have initiated conversations about map accessibility in different spaces--at work, in the classroom, and at community technology events. We’ll share a set of map accessibility guidelines that emerged at a civic hack-a-thon, and that we’re continually working on refining and bringing into community conversations. This presentation isn’t a checklist; instead, it’s a starting point to help stimulate ongoing conversations around map accessibility. We’ll share our stories and provide some resources and strategies for incorporating accessibility conversations into your day-to-day work.*
