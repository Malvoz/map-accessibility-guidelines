# Map Accessibility Guidelines
A set of guidelines for developers, cartographers, GIS specialists, geographers, and civic hackers to consider when creating projects including web maps.

Check out a summary of some [Best Practices](/BestPractices.md) and accompanying [code snippets](/code-snippets). Our [Wiki site](../../wiki) contains additional background information about accessibility and some additional web and print [resources](../../wiki/Resources) you may want to check out.

## Minnesota Standards and Tools
Since 2016, the State of Minnesota, the University of Minnesota, and MetCouncil has spearheaded an effort which has resulted in a set of standards and tools on maps for:  
* Map Design  
* Static Maps (e.g., PDF and PNG)  
* Interactive Web Maps  

The standards and tools can be found on [Minnesota's Office of Accessibility webpage](https://mn.gov/mnit/about-mnit/accessibility/maps).
