# Links
Every link should **_make sense out of context_**, even if the link text is read by itself. Screen reader users may choose to read only the links on a web page when they're trying to navigate quickly.

Certain phrases like **_"click here" and "more" must be avoided._** If we use phrases like 'click here' not only can it be confusing for those with screen readers, we lose the attention of other visitors that are scanning our pages. By rewriting our links, we are helping **all audiences**!
