# Add a Table and/or List

Donâ€™t have the map be your only format for data display, supplement your map with a table and/or list (i.e. directions/routing, data display, etc.).  

Adding an additional format for your content in the form of a table or list provides another resource to blind, and even colorblind users when maps are involved.  In this way a larger proportion of your audience can benefit from the content you are displaying, including users who may not be visually impaired at all (helping all audiences visiting your map).

List example:
<img width="963" alt="screenshot of map with route displayed by lines on a map and in a written table of directions" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5023024/10264522/035db1b4-69d4-11e5-8e6c-9faadd3f0f9d.png">

Table example:
<img width="1280" alt="screenshot of a written table with information on asthma hospitalizations displayed in front of a map" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5023024/10264548/b2c01926-69d4-11e5-814f-3c131eca97d3.png">

**_Other Notes:_**
* When designing navigational tools, offer both "route" and "map" options.  
* Remember that people have different ways of orienting themselves and absorbing geographic information, including perceiving space and spatial concepts.
