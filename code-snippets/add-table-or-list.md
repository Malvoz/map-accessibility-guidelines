# Add a Table and/or List

**Supplement your map with a table or list.** Donâ€™t have the map be your only format for data display, supplement your map with a table and/or list (i.e. directions/routing, data display, etc.).  

Adding additional content in the form of a table or list for users also provides another resource to blind, and even colorblind users when maps are involved.

In this way a larger proportion of your audience can benefit from the content you are displaying, including users who may not be visually impaired at all (helping all audiences visiting your map).

**_Other Notes:_**
* When designing navigational tools, offer both "route" and "map" options.  
* Remember that people have different ways of orienting themselves and absorbing geographic information, including perceiving space and spatial concepts.
