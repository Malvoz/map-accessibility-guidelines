### Ensure accessibility of non-HTML content (e.g. PDF files, forms, Microsoft Word documents, and PowerPoint presentations):
In addition to all of the other principles, PDF documents, forms, and other non-HTML content **_must be as accessible as possible_**.

If you cannot make these materials accessible, consider using HTML instead or, at the very least, provide an accessible alternative. PDF documents and forms should also include a series of labels, with organization, to make it more accessible. A PDF file with labels looks the same, but it is almost always more accessible to a person using a screen reader.
