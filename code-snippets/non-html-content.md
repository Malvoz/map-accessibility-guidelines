# Non-HTML Content

**Ensure accessibility of non-HTML content**. Such as:
* Adobe PDF documents
* Forms
* Microsoft Word documents
* Microsoft PowerPoint presentations

In addition to all of the other principles, PDF documents, forms, and other non-HTML content **_must be as accessible as possible_**. If you cannot make these materials accessible, consider using HTML instead or, at the very least, provide an accessible alternative to visitors.

PDF documents and forms should also include a series of labels, with organization, to make it more accessible. A PDF file with labels looks the same, but it is almost always more accessible to a person using a screen reader.

## WAVE Chrome extension  
If you are designing an interactive map, with an option to download non-HTML content, the [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org) Chrome extension will provide an alert indicating a separate review is needed to confirm it's accessibility, like so:  
<img width="217" alt="WAVE screenshot indicating a PDF document is present and a separate accessibility review is needed to confirm its accessibility" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5023024/47260231-eb173500-d47c-11e8-991b-4e6320f2d99f.png">
