# Color

## 1. Contrast  
**_Contrast impacts everybody_**. Ensure sufficient contrast exists between text and its background. Common sense is vital when considering color contrast, if you can't differentiate the colors, nobody else can. Use simple, high-contrast color schemes.

## 2. Patterns  
**Donâ€™t use color alone to convey information**; consider patterns, line widths, etc.

While we use color to highlight or compliment what is already visible, do not use color alone to convey information. That information may not be available to a person who is colorblind, and will be unavailable to screen reader users.  Remember especially: red + green = bad!

## 3. Human Perception
**People see color before they absorb anything else**. Many of the most recognizable brands in the world rely on color for instant recognition.

Color plays an incredibly important role in the world and can sway thinking, change actions, and cause reactions. It can irritate or soothe one's eyes, raise blood pressure, or even suppress appetite. As a powerful form of communication, color is irreplaceable. For example: Red means *stop* and green means *go*.

Likewise, as seen in the image below, the colors used for a product, web site, business card, or logo cause powerful reactions (especially when flipped!).
