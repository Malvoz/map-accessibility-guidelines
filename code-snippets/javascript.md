### Make JavaScript as accessible as possible:
Make your best effort to ensure that [JavaScript event handlers](http://webaim.org/techniques/javascript/eventhandlers) are device independent (i.e. events do not require the use of a mouse) and that your page does not rely on JavaScript to function. (**_Note:_** This is not always possible with interactive maps but make your best effort while designing your map if other alternatives are possible).

**Don't make people hover to find things.** The hover and focus should have the same functionality throughout an application *([see code snippet below](#code1))*. Simple things should be simple, complex things should be *possible*.
