### Organize your HTML document structure:
Headings, lists, and other structural elements provide meaning and structure to web pages. Also, **_headings should never be empty_** as empty headings cannot be read by a screen reader. Headings are a key component as they are also read by search engines and can help direct **all** users to your site.

**_Don't skip heading levels:_** The document structure can also facilitate keyboard navigation within the page. For example, don't skip from a `<h1>` tag to a `<h3>` tag without using a `<h2>` tag in between the two. Blind users with screen readers have a difficult time navigating through content when a solid document structure is not set in place. In addition to serving those that are blind, document structure helps organize a page for other users and helps you maintain the page in the future.

**_However, you can skip backward_** For example, if you have already labeled your heading tags `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, and `<h4>` then you can skip to a `<h3>` tag without labeling the `<h1>` or `<h2>` tags since they are shown earlier in your code.

Make map elements keyboard-accessible.

**Headers**: Avoid using empty headers (`<th>`).
