### Think mobile first:
**Don't assume all users have ready access to desktop or laptop computers.** Be aware that your users may only have Internet access via phones or other mobile devices.  Keep them in mind when building accessible maps!

In fact, as of 2013:
> "34% of cell internet users go online mostly using their phones, and not using some other device such as a desktop or laptop computer." -[Pew Research Center](http://www.pewinternet.org/fact-sheets/mobile-technology-fact-sheet)

Don't ever let your map's div be at 100% width, or mobile users often can't scroll to any content below the map!  (Especially be careful when using Bootstrap that it doesn't kick the map into 100% width and lock users into "map nav prison".)
